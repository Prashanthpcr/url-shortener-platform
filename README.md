# QuickLink: A Full-Stack URL Shortening Service

A **production-grade, full-stack application** providing a comprehensive URL shortening service. Engineered for **scalability** and **high performance**, this platform is built with a modern, decoupled architecture featuring a **React frontend** and a robust, containerized **Java Spring Boot backend API**. The entire system is deployed on **Render** with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.

## üöÄ Live Demo

You can use the live application here:  
**[QuickLink Live Demo](https://url-shortener-frontend-fmej.onrender.com)**

> **Note:** Free tier services on Render may "spin down" after a period of inactivity, so the first load might be slightly slow.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Interactive & Responsive Frontend**  
  A clean, user-friendly interface built with React that allows for seamless bulk URL shortening and a dynamic results display.

- **High-Throughput Batch Processing**  
  A powerful API endpoint (`/api/v1/shorten-batch`) capable of shortening hundreds of URLs in a single request, with a detailed `207 Multi-Status` response that reports the status of each individual URL.

- **High-Performance Caching**  
  Leverages Redis to cache frequently accessed URLs, drastically reducing database load and ensuring near-instantaneous redirection for popular links.

- **Automated Cloud Deployment**  
  Zero-touch CI/CD pipeline. Any git push to the main branch automatically triggers a build and deployment of the appropriate service (frontend or backend) on Render with zero downtime.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technology Stack

The system is designed as a **decoupled multi-service architecture**, with a distinct separation between the frontend, backend, database, and cache.
